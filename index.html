            <p>Imaginative Tales was an American fantasy and science fiction magazine launched in September 1954 by
                William
                Hamling's Greenleaf Publishing Company. It began as a vehicle for novel-length humorous fantasy, with
                initial
                issues featuring stories by Charles F. Myers and Robert Bloch. After a year, Hamling switched the focus
                to
                science fiction, and it became similar in content to its sister magazine Imagination, publishing routine
                space
                operas. In 1958, with public interest in space high, Hamling changed the title to Space Travel, but
                there
                was
                little effect on sales. Magazine circulation was suffering because of the rise of the paperback, and the
                liquidation in 1957 of American News Company, a major magazine distributor, made it even harder for
                small
                magazines to survive. Hamling eventually folded both Imaginative Tales and Imagination in 1958,
                preferring
                to
                invest the money in Rogue, a men's magazine he had started in imitation of Playboy in 1955</p>
